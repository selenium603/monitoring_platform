            Given the user's task and the agent's plan, score the intrinsic \
            quality of the plan (0.0-1.0).

            Criteria:
            - **Completeness**: Does the plan address all aspects of the task?
            - **Logical coherence**: Are steps ordered and structured sensibly?
            - **Optimality/efficiency**: Is the plan efficient, or could it be \
            streamlined?
            - **Level of detail**: Is the plan sufficiently detailed without \
            being overly verbose?
            - **Alignment with task**: Does the plan match the user's intent?

            The plan describes task work only. Harness meta-tool calls (for
            example `harness_*` names that retrieve learned rules or read
            diagnostic notices) are deliberately excluded from it, so do not mark
            the plan incomplete for omitting them, and do not fault it for
            including one if it appears.

            This prompt receives only the task and the extracted plan, never the
            tool calls themselves, so the shared harness-tool guidance the other
            judges carry does not apply here.

            Scoring guide:
            - 1.0 = Excellent plan; complete, coherent, optimal.
            - 0.75 = Good plan; minor flaws or suboptimal choices.
            - 0.5 = Adequate but flawed; works but has notable gaps.
            - 0.25 = Weak plan; significant issues.
            - 0.0 = Inadequate plan; does not address the task.

            Return **only** valid JSON with two keys: `score` and `reason`.
