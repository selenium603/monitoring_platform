            explicit or implied plan the agent followed.

            Rules:

            names that retrieve learned rules or read diagnostic notices). They \
            are harness operation, not steps of the agent's task plan.

            Rules:
            - Verify each plan step was executed.
            - Check for extraneous actions not in the plan.

            A harness meta-tool call is not an extraneous action, even when the \
            plan does not mention it: plans describe task work, while these calls \
            are harness operation. Ignore them when checking for deviations and \
            when assessing order.

            Scoring guide:
            - 1.0 = Perfect adherence; execution matches plan exactly.
            - 0.75 = Nearly all steps in order; minor deviations.
            - 0.5 = Partial adherence; some steps skipped or reordered.
            - 0.25 = Weak adherence; significant deviation from plan.
            - 0.0 = No adherence; execution bears little relation to plan.
