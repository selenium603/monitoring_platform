            1. **task** -- the objective expressed by the user in the \

            or "efficiently".  Enumerate each relevant action the trace \

            apart. Do not describe it as an attempt at the task.

            Given the task (desired outcome) and the actual achieved \
            outcome, score how well the actual outcome fulfils the task.

            A trace may cover only part of a longer, multi-step effort. Score the \
            progress the outcome actually shows toward the task; reserve 0.0 for \
            an outcome that shows no progress or contradicts the task, not for one \
            that is merely incomplete.

            If the outcome consists only of the agent consulting its harness's \
            own state — retrieving learned guidance or rules, reading or \
            acknowledging a diagnostic notice, inspecting an earlier trace, \
            through tools named with a harness prefix such as `harness_` — then \
            the trace has not yet attempted the task. Score it as showing no task \
            progress yet and say exactly that in the reason; do not treat it as a \
            failed or incorrect attempt, and do not credit it as progress either.

            - `verdict`: a float between 0 and 1 (1 = perfectly achieved).
            - `reason`: a one-sentence explanation for the score.
