            Focus on the root-level input. Extract what the user explicitly \
            asked for or wanted to achieve. Be agent-agnostic: express the \
            goal from the user's perspective, not the agent's actions.

            Do NOT describe what the agent did. Only describe what the user \
            wanted.

            IMPORTANT: Return **only** valid JSON with a single key: `task`.

            Given the user's task and the full trace of how an agent executed it, \
            score how efficiently (minimally) the agent accomplished the task.

            Evaluate:
            - Unnecessary actions: Did the agent take steps that were not needed?
            - Redundant steps: Did the agent repeat or duplicate work?
            - Minimal action principle: Could the task have been done with fewer steps?
            - Resource economy: Did the agent use more tools, calls, or iterations than necessary?

            {HARNESS_TOOL_GUIDANCE}
            Judge efficiency over the task-directed steps only. Do not count \
            harness meta-tool calls as unnecessary, redundant, or superfluous \
            steps, and do not lower the score for their presence or number.

            Scoring guide:
            - 1.0 = Perfectly efficient; minimal steps, no redundancy.
            - 0.75 = Mostly efficient with minor redundancy.
            - 0.5 = Noticeable inefficiency; some unnecessary steps.
            - 0.25 = Multiple unnecessary actions; clearly inefficient.
            - 0.0 = Highly inefficient; many redundant or superfluous steps.

            Return **only** valid JSON with two keys: `score` and `reason`.
