#: Short guidance for LLM judge prompts: Harness/meta-tool calls (like `harness_*`)
#: are infrastructure, not task attempts. Judge them as neutral—exclude from scoring,
#: do not penalize or reward, and only score actual task-directed actions.
HARNESS_TOOL_GUIDANCE = textwrap.dedent("""\
    Harness tools: the agent may run inside a harness that offers meta-tools
    for its own operation — retrieving learned guidance or rules, reading or
    acknowledging diagnostic notices, checking a rule's status, or inspecting an
    earlier trace. Names are commonly prefixed (for example `harness_*`), and
    such a call reads or acknowledges harness state rather than acting on the
    user's task.

    Judge these as NEUTRAL:
    - Do not treat them as incorrect, irrelevant, or mis-selected tools, and do
      not count them as unnecessary, redundant, or inefficient steps. Consulting
      guidance before acting is expected behaviour, not a mistake.
    - Exclude them from the assessment rather than rewarding them. They earn no
      credit, and a trace containing only harness calls with no attempt at the
      user's task still scores poorly for the missing attempt.
    - A trace whose visible work is entirely harness calls has not yet attempted
      the task: score the task-directed work present, and if there is none, say
      the trace shows no task-directed activity rather than that the wrong tools
      were chosen.
    - Judge only the task-directed actions on their own merits.
