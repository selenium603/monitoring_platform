"""End-to-end tests for the Stripe webhook route against a real database.

These drive the full path a Stripe delivery actually takes — HTTP POST, signature
verification, event dispatch, handler, DB commit — and then assert the rows
changed.  The unit tests in ``tests/unit/test_stripe_api_contract.py`` cover the
field accessors in isolation; these prove the wiring works for real.

The payloads are shaped like the pinned API version (``2026-03-25.dahlia``),
where an invoice carries its subscription at
``parent.subscription_details.subscription`` rather than at the top level.
Reading the old path returned ``None``, so every ``invoice.paid`` exited early and
no billing period was ever marked billed.
